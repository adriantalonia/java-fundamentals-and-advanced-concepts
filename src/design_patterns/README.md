## Java Design Patterns

### What is a Design Pattern?

In a software industry, Design Pattern is a description or guideline to solve a problem that occurs repeatedly while
developing a software Application. Some people in the industry also call it a template as it solves the problems while
developing the application. When we talk about these types of solutions to recurring problems in Java language, they
become ‘Design Patterns in Java’ or ‘Java Design Patterns’.

### Why these Design Patterns named as GoF?

It was 21 October 1994, when four authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, with a foreword
by Grady Booch, published a book titled as Design Patterns – Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software which
launched the concept of Design Pattern in Software design. These four authors are altogether known as the Gang of Four (
GoF). Since then, these are called GoF Design Patterns.
